Coursera Data Products Project

To run the shiny application found at http://sbushmanov.shinyapps.io/returns/ 
you need three files, found in `"/returns"` folder :

- `global.R` : to download and preprocess data  
- `ui.R` : part of shiny app. User interface to obtain intercative data from user inputs  
- `server.R` : part of shiny app. Calculates outputs and passes them back to `ui.R` based
on user inputs.

The code for shiny app is fully reproducible.
